Introduction
=== 

[Terminator](https://github.com/freiz/terminator) is a library written in C++ for spam filtering, like the famous [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/)
and [OSBF-Lua](https://github.com/arunpersaud/osbf-lua). It can be embedded into other spam filtering software or service as a machine learning module. The advantages are 

* Very high precision and recall, best results on all public spam filtering corpus.
* Suitable for both server-side and client-side spam filtering on a typical PC.

Terminator can be used in any other binary text classification problems, especially those that need an adaptive model for online learning. 

Terminator is **not** a complete E2E spam filtering solution. Instead, it focuses on the machine learning part without blocklist/allowlist or DKIM. My paper, "[An](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/panwk/publications/Journal-IEEE-IS-14-AFSD.pdf) Adaptive Fusion Algorithm for Spam Detection](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/panwk/publications/Journal-IEEE-IS-14-AFSD.pdf)" described the implementation in detail.

Implementation
===
Terminator used a fusion model, which includes eight machine learning algorithms to boost spam filtering performance. The algorithms are listed below according to papers

* [Naive Bayes](http://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps242/Fall09/lect/12/CEAS2006_corrected-naiveBayesSpam.pdf)
* [Not So Naive Bayes](http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI09/paper/view/240/1033)
* [Online Logistic Regression](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GoodmanYih-ceas06.pdf)
* [HIT](http://www.ceas.cc/2008/papers/china.pdf)
* [Winnow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/papers/kdd06_final.pdf)
* [Balanced Winnow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/papers/kdd06_final.pdf)
* [Passive Aggressive](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/CrammerDeShSi03.pdf)
* [On-line Perceptron Algorithm with Margins](http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/trec.2006.spam.pdf)

Installation & Usage
===

### Step 1, Install Dependencies
The only dependency is [kyotocabinet](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/)](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/) for persistence, which must be installed first.

### Step 2, Install Terminator and Compile
```bash
clone https://github.com/freiz/terminator.git
cd terminator
make
```
You can change the compiler suite in Makefile; the output is a static linkable lib.

### Step 3, Write an Example
```c++
#include "terminator.h"

// The first parameter is the path of database file
// The second parameter is the main memory used as cache, the unit is Byte, so 5 << 20 is around 5MB as cache
Terminator* classifier = new Terminator("terminator.kch", 5 << 20);

// Now you can write the main logic
// There are two public api, Train and Predict

// [Predict] pass in the email content and return a score ranging from 0 (100% ham) to 1 (100% spam)
// You can change the threshold to make the decision on your own 
double score = classifier->Predict(std::string email_content);

// [Train] pass in the email content and a flag
// If spam train, the flag set to true or false
classifier->Train(std::string email_content, boolean is_spam)
```

### Step 4, Play with Demo (Optional)
```bash
make run-demo
```
It will run a demo application to simulate spam filtering using the SpamAssassin corpus; you can also put another dataset (such as [ceas08](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/ceascorpus/)) under demo/corpus to check the experiment result.

### Step 5, Compile and Link Your bits
Do not forget to link against the library kyotocabinet.
